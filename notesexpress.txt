Express.js, or simply Express, is a minimal and popular back-end web application framework for Node.js. 
It's designed to build web applications and APIs quickly and easily.

Think of Node.js as the engine of a car, providing the raw power (the JavaScript runtime environment). 
Express is like the car's frame, steering wheel, and pedalsâ€”it 
provides a structure and set of tools that make it much easier to build a 
functional web server without having to start from scratch.




Key Features
Routing: Express provides a simple yet powerful routing system to handle different HTTP requests 
         (like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) at different URLs (or "routes"). 
         This allows you to define what your application should do when a user visits /home versus /profile.

Middleware: This is a core concept in Express. Middleware functions are like checkpoints 
            that a request goes through before a final response is sent. 
            They can perform tasks like logging requests, parsing incoming data (like JSON or form data), 
            authenticating users, or handling errors.

Flexibility: Express is unopinionated, meaning it doesn't force you to use a specific file structure 
             or set of tools. This "minimalist" approach gives you the freedom to structure your 
             application and choose the components (like template engines or databases)
            that best fit your project.

Templating: While Express doesn't have a built-in template engine, 
            it integrates seamlessly with popular ones like Pug, EJS, 
            and Handlebars. These allow you to insert dynamic data into HTML files on the 
            server before sending them to the client.




Q: What's the difference between Node.js and Express.js?
A:

Node.js is the JavaScript runtime environment. It's what allows you to run JavaScript on the server. 
It provides low-level features like handling HTTP requests, file I/O, and networking.

Express.js is a framework built on top of Node.js. 
It simplifies the process of building a web server. 
It handles things like routing, middleware, and request/response management, 
which you would otherwise have to build from scratch using only Node.js.
