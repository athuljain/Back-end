What is Node.js?
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside the browser. Built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, it enables developers to use JavaScript for server-side programming, revolutionizing web development.


Key Features of Node.js
JavaScript Runtime: Run JavaScript code outside the browser.
Cross-Platform: Compatible with multiple operating systems.
Non-Blocking I/O: Handles multiple requests efficiently.
Package Manager (npm): Access thousands of reusable libraries.







express js



Express is the most popular Node.js web framework, and is the underlying library for a number of other popular Node.js frameworks. It provides mechanisms to:

Write handlers for requests with different HTTP verbs at different URL paths (routes).
Integrate with "view" rendering engines in order to generate responses by inserting data into templates.
Set common web application settings like the port to use for connecting, and the location of templates that are used for rendering the response.
Add additional request processing "middleware" at any point within the request handling pipeline.





Express.js is a fast, unopinionated, and minimalist web framework for Node.js.
It simplifies routing, middleware management, and API handling.
Used for building web applications and REST APIs.



npm install express



const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Hello, Express!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});



1. What is Express.js?
Express.js is a web framework for Node.js used to build web applications and RESTful APIs.
2. How does Express.js differ from Node.js?
Node.js is a runtime environment that executes JavaScript.
Express.js is a framework built on Node.js that simplifies web development.
3. What is middleware in Express.js?
Middleware functions in Express process request objects before sending responses.
4. Explain routing in Express.js.
Routing refers to defining URL paths and handling HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
5.  What is CORS, and how do you enable it in Express?
CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) allows requests from different origins.
Enable using the cors package.
